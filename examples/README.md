# Using Web Components

- Web Components are reusable widgets available as custom HTML element
- <image-crop-element> is one such WC
  - To use this custom element in an HTML page, we need a .js file containing code for creating the custom HTML element
  - It is available as npm installable
  - unpkg.com helps make npm installables as .js (external file)
    - To download the .js, use link `https://unpkg.com/@github/image-crop-element@latest/dist/index.esm.js`
